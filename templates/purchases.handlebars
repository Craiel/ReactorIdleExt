    I really like making games and have been building them from my free time for a very long time. (Check my games)<br/>

    But as game making is very time consuming (I have two young children and a full time job at a startup. So if you can
    relate, imagine that :p),
    I highly appreciate any support - would it be ideas, comments, criticism or monetary!<br/>

    With this game I have good ideas on what features to add and if you like this game, I kindly ask you to show your
    support by making a
    purchase. I don't expect these games to pay a salary, but to cover at least some of the time I put into making them.
    :)<br/>
    I really don't like monetizing strategies games use nowadays - pay for every freaking move, so most certainly I will
    not follow them.<br/>
